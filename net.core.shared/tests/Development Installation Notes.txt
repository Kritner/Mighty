Development Installation Notes:
===============================

SQL Server:
-----------

The test database is AdventureWorks (AdventureWorks2014 works fine, probably higher too, but not tested), downloadable from:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure

Some additional SPs have been added to this (run `MightyTests\Sql\SqlServerSPTests.sql` to create).

There is also a separate test database for writes, which is created using `MightyTests\Sql\WriteTestDB_Create.sql`.

Oracle:
-------

- Npgsql-3.2.0.msi
	o This is for PostgreSQL
	o "Installs Npgsql into the GAC and madds it to your machine.config. This is not the recommended way to use Npgsql (use nuget instead)."
	o For now, I have done this.

- Unzip ODP.NET_Managed_ODAC12cR4.zip
	o This is for Oracle managed data access client (oracle.manageddataaccess.client)
	o Run as Administrator 'install_odpm.bat C:\Oracle both' (installs x86 and x64 - I may have only done x64 before, hence those tests failing?)

- Unzip OracleXE112_Win64.zip (Oracle Database 11g Express Edition)
	o Run setup.exe to install 
	o Choose a password for SYS and SYSTEM accounts (I chose the GRB db admin password)
	o For now, add oravirtualnerd as an alias to 127.0.0.1 to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
	o You can already connect from a command prompt, use:
		`SQLPLUS / AS SYSDBA` (see https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B25329_01/doc/admin.102/b25107/startup.htm)
	o From here, you can install the SCOTT database (http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/SCOTT)
		`@ ?/rdbms/admin/scott.sql`
		`ALTER USER scott ACCOUNT UNLOCK;`
	o To check, you can now connect to this DB from the command line:
		`SQLPLUS SCOTT\TIGER`
		And `SELECT * FROM emp;` should work
	
- Unzip sqldeveloper-4.1.5.21.78-x64.zip (Oracle SQL Developer)
	o This is the program itself, it does not need further installation
	o Connect to localhost as SYSTEM/<password>

SQLite:
-------

- Tools for managing the SQLite DB are in sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3170000.zip, but these are not needed to run the tests

- The Microsoft SQLite data provider must be installed (`Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` for .NET Core, or `System.Data.SQLite` for .NET Framework)
  TO DO: How? (These may be installed by default, I think.)

- The database for all SQLite tests is the autonumber variant of the Chinook example DB for SQLite,
  i.e. `Chinook_Sqlite_AutoIncrementPKs.sqlite` from https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/tree/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources
