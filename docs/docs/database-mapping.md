# Database Mapping
{: .no_toc }

- TOC
{:toc}

Like Massive, Mighty supports [manual mapping](#manual-mapping) which is useful for knocking up quick, read-only column name mapping, but Mighty also now supports full [convention based mapping](#convention-based-mapping) (i.e. class to database name mapping functions) and [attribute based mapping](#attribute-based-mapping).

---

## Manual Mapping

For read-only purposes (and also for knocking up quick SQL data transforms) you can just map your column names to field names using the `columns` parameter (in the constructor, or in the data access method):

```c#
var films = new MightyOrm(
    connectionString,
    tableName: "film",
    columns: "film_id AS FilmID, description AS Description");
var films = films.All();
foreach (var film in films)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{film.FilmID}: {film.Description}");
}
```

This type of mapping will work with strongly-typed instances of `MightyOrm<T>` too.

## Convention Based Mapping

For more control and the ability to support writes as well as reads, you can use convention based mapping or [attribute based mapping](#attribute-based-mapping) or both.

Here's a quick convention based map for a strongly-typed instance of Mighty:

```c#

public class Film
{
    public int FilmID;
    public string Description;
}

...

var films = new MightyOrm<Film>(
    connectionString,
    mapper: new SqlNamingMapper(columnNameMapping: (t, n) =>
        n
        .Map("FilmID", "film_id")
        .Map("Film.Description", "description"));
```

The `.Map` string extension method for creating quick maps and used above is defined in `Mighty.Mapping`, but is entirely optional.

As long as you provide a `columns` parameter, you can even do convention based mapping on a dynamic instance of Mighty ðŸ˜Š :

```c#
var films = new MightyOrm(
    connectionString,
    tableName: "film",
    columns: "FilmID, Description",
    mapper: new SqlNamingMapper(columnNameMapping: (t, n) =>
        n
        .Map("FilmID", "film_id")
        .Map("Description", "description"));
var films = films.All();
foreach (var film in films)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{film.FilmID}: {film.Description}");
}
```

### More Control
{: .no_toc }

In addition to mapping column names, you can map class to table names, set primary keys and more by providing any of the following functions to Mighty's `SqlNamingMapper`:

 - Func<Type, string> TableNameMapping
 - Func<Type, string, string> ColumnNameMapping
 - Func<Type, string> GetPrimaryKeyFieldNames
 - Func<Type, string> GetSequenceName
 - Func<Type, string, bool> IgnoreColumn
 - Func<Type, bool> CaseSensitiveColumns
 - Func<string, string> QuoteDatabaseIdentifier
 - Func<Type, AutoMap> AutoMap (see [below](#auto-mapping-in-mighty))

## Attribute Based Mapping

Mighty also supports attribute based mapping:

```c#

[DatabaseTable("film")]
public class MyFilmClass
{
    [DatabaseColumn("film_id")]
    public int FilmID;

    // class-column mapping in Mighty is not case sensitive by default
    // (unless you set it to case-sensitive, you don't actually need this mappping)
    [DatabaseColumn("description")]
    public string Description;
}

...

var films = new MightyOrm<MyFilmClass>(connectionString);
var films = films.All();
foreach (var film in films)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{film.FilmID}: {film.Description}");
}
```

In addition to mapping field or property names to column names and class names to table names, you can also tell Mighty to ignore columns with `[DatabaseIgnore]`
and you can specify primary key fields directly in the class definition using `[DatabasePrimaryKey]`.

> You can get Mighty to read and write non-public data members by applying `[DatabaseColumn]` (with or without any constructor parameters) to fields or properties which you control.

Even though most features of `SqlNamingMapper` can be done instead using attributes, and vice versa, there is no way to get Mighty to access non-public fields or properties purely using `SqlNamingMapper`, you have to use the `[DatabaseColumn]` attribute instead. This is on purpose, to make it hard to intentionally or unintentionally make Mighty get or write object data which it shouldn't have access to.

## Auto-Mapping in Mighty

Once you apply any column name mapping, Mighty switches on field name mapping by default. This is simply to make your life more convenient, and it can easily be disabled if you don't want it. The rules are as follows:

|----|----|----|----|
|`MightyOrm` contructor or method parameter|Default (no columns renamed)|Some columns renamed, but auto-mapping manually disabled|Default auto-mapping, once some columns renamed|
|----|----|----|----|
|`primaryKeys`|List of primary key names|Column name(s) only, e.g. `"film_id"`|C# field/property name(s) only (e.g. `"FilmID"`)|
|`columns`|Any valid SQL column specification|Any valid SQL column specification (e.g. `"film_id AS FilmID, LTRIM(RTRIM(description)) AS Description"`)|C# field/property names only (e.g. `"FilmID, Description"`)|
|`orderBy`|Any valid SQL `ORDER BY` specification|Any valid SQL `ORDER BY` specification (e.g. `"LEN(description)"`)|C# field/property names only, but with ASC and DESC support (e.g. `"Description DESC"`)|

You can provide a set of flags which will turn auto-mapping off (for some, none or all of the above items) by passing an `autoMap` function to `SqlNamingMapper`, or by setting the `autoMap` parameter on the `DatabaseTable` attribute.

> Just like Massive, Mighty assembles SQL fragments which you pass in (e.g. `where`, `columns`, `orderBy`). Also just like Massive, [database parameters](parameters) *are never directly interpolated into SQL* and instead are always passed to the underlying database as true `DbParameter` values. (This is essential to help avoid SQL injection attacks.)

### Maintainable auto-mapping:
{: .no_toc }

With auto-mapping (or as the default, with no column renaming), instead of using raw strings as your field/column names which are passed in to Mighty you can (completely optionally) use the C# `nameof` function instead. This is more future-proof against field renames, and in general just allows your IDE to track references to the field name for you:

```c#
var films = films.All(orderBy: nameof(Film.FilmID));
```

To get the same effect if you have column renames but have manually disabled auto-mapping, you additionally have to map the column name. You can do this as follows:

```c#
var films = films.All(orderBy: films.DataContract.Map(nameof(Film.FilmID));
```
